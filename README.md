# Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

This repository contains the assignment for the Academic Course "Advanced_Signal_Processing_Techniques" taught in the Spring of 2018-2019 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical & Computer Engineering. The projects were written in Matlab.

### 1st Project

The aim of the project is the familiarization with the field of signal processing implemented in biomedical signals. More specifically, **Higher Order Statistics, spectra** and **AR HOS Models** are considered in the 1st project. 

#### 2nd Project

In the 2nd project different **Time Frequency Analysis (TFA)** techniques are implemented in ECG (Electrocardiography) signals. The following techniques were implemented for the analysis of 5 signals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database of Physionet. 

1. Short Time Fourier Transform (**STFT**)
2. Wigner Distribution Function (**WDF**)
3. Wavelet Transform (**WT)**  with different wavelet families
4. Hilbert-Huang Transform (**HHT**) , with Empirical Mode Mecomposition (<u>EMD</u>) or Ensemble EMD (<u>EEMD</u>)

The differences and advantages of each method were examined and applied to detect different points of interest (PVC or APC beats, isolated beats, sinus arrhythmia and other) for each cardiogram.  Furthermore,  R-R intervals were calculated with HHT and compared with RMSE.
